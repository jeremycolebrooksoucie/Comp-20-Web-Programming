Files contain javascript that dubs a video of the kentucky
state national anthem. It also adds memorable pictures that
change with the music. css for index.hmtl is also included. 

Pictures used include horse1 - horse4. These are inserted below
the video. 

All aspects of project have been successfully completed. I did not
collaborate with anyone. 

Time spent: 1.5 hours
